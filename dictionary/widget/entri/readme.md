# Widget Entri Dictionary
An easy way to create a [blogger template](https://rizkysaskiaputra.blogspot.com/p/template-blogger.html) is to recognize special data tags for bloggers, such as data tags for this blog entry, because this type of data tag is important as a main component for loading blogger content.

Blog Widget is an *official Blogger* widget that will display the main page, index page, item page, posting page, static page, label page, archive page, search page and others.

Widget blogger now has 3 versions, the first version is the basic version, the second version is the widget update the first version which gets a little update, so it can be said to be still a *basic version*. The third version is the latest version and gets a lot of developments, like Conditional Tags more simple, there are even some special tags that are deliberately deleted.

Many blogger template makers still use the first or second version of blogger, most likely because it's easy to use. Meanwhile there are also blogger template makers who use the latest version of bloggers namely *Igniel.com*, *BungFrangki.com* and many more.

The advantage of using the **latest version** of the [blogger template](https://rizkysaskiaputra.blogspot.com/p/template-blogger.html) is that it looks different, just seems more professional "*than others*". Only that? no, there are other benefits such as our template cannot be "*copied*". It might still work, but not with the template seasoning. Template seasoning means pure source code. This means that the code is privately owned and cannot be copied by others.

A little story, a few months ago I accidentally visited a blog belonging to "*Google blogger employee*" from *France*, in his blog he revealed and shared the official source code and some pure tricks to create a [blogger template](https://rizkysaskiaputra.blogspot.com/p/template-blogger.html) as a whole. I learned many things from the blog and I visualize this blog.

Many bloggers outsmart to make "*Posts in accordance with certain labels*" with javascript, in fact it does not need to be done because there is why the source code. This proves that especially the [blogger template](https://rizkysaskiaputra.blogspot.com/p/template-blogger.html) makers still do not know the original source code.

Returning to the topic of the Data Tag Dictionary for Blog Entries on Blogger. There are two versions namely JSON and XML, JSON as proof to see whether it works or not, XML is a special data tag that is used to call or create certain content.

## TL;DR
Adjust the version of your template.
